   * The minimum power of two at which Envoy starts tracking an account.
   * Envoy has 8 power of two buckets starting with the provided exponent below.

   * [2^minimum_account_to_track_power_of_two,
   * 2^(minimum_account_to_track_power_of_two + 1)) bytes.
   * With the 8th bucket tracking accounts
   * &gt;= 128 * 2^minimum_account_to_track_power_of_two.
   * The maximum value is 56, since we're using uint64_t for bytes counting,
   * and that's the last value that would use the 8 buckets. In practice,
   * we don't expect the proxy to be holding 2^56 bytes.
   * If omitted, Envoy should not do any tracking.
