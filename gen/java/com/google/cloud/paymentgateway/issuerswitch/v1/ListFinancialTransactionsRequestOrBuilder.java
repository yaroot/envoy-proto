   * Filters are not case sensitive.
   * The following fields in the `FinancialTransaction` are eligible for
   * filtering:
   *   * `transactionType` - The transaction type of the financial
   *   transaction. Must be one of [TransactionType][google.cloud.paymentgateway.issuerswitch.v1.TransactionType] values. For financial
   *   transactions, only valid transaction types are `TRANSACTION_TYPE_CREDIT`,
   *   `TRANSACTION_TYPE_DEBIT` and `TRANSACTION_TYPE_REVERSAL`. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.

   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `payerVPA` - The VPA of the payer in a financial transaction. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `payeeVPA` - The VPA of the payee in a financial transaction. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `payerMobileNumber` - The mobile number of the payer in a financial
   *      transaction. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `payeeMobileNumber` - The mobile number of the payee in a financial
   *      transaction. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.

   *   * `createTime` - The time at which the transaction was created
   *   (received) by the issuer switch. The value should be in
   *   the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Allowed comparison operators: `&gt;`,
   *   `&lt;`.
   *   * `state` - The state of the transaction. Must be one of
   *   [TransactionInfo.State][google.cloud.paymentgateway.issuerswitch.v1.TransactionInfo.State] values. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `errorCode` - Use this filter to list financial transactions which
   *   have failed a particular error code. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `bankAdapterRequestID` - Request ID used when invoking the Bank
   *   Adapter API for fulfilling a transaction request. Allowed comparison
   *   operators: `=`.
   * You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in
   * parentheses. Expressions are combined with AND logic. No other logical
   * operators are supported.
