   * An expression that filters the list of complaint transactions.
   * A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and
   * a value for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a
   * boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, or `=`.
   * Filters are not case sensitive.
   * The following fields in the `Complaint` are eligible for
   * filtering:
   *   * `transactionID` - The transaction ID of the complaint transaction.
   *   Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `transactionType` - The transaction type of the complaint
   *   transaction. Must be one of [TransactionType][google.cloud.paymentgateway.issuerswitch.v1.TransactionType] values. For complaint
   *   transactions, only valid transaction types are
   *  `TRANSACTION_TYPE_CHECK_STATUS`, `TRANSACTION_TYPE_COMPLAINT`,
   *  `TRANSACTION_TYPE_REVERSAL`, `TRANSACTION_TYPE_DISPUTE`,
   *  `TRANSACTION_TYPE_REFUND` or `TRANSACTION_TYPE_STATUS_UPDATE`. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `originalRRN` - The retrieval reference number of the original
   *   transaction for which complaint / dispute was raised / resolved. Allowed
   *   comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `createTime` - The time at which the transaction was created
   *   (received) by the issuer switch. The value should be in
   *   the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Allowed comparison
   *   operators: `&gt;`, `&lt;`.
   *   * `state` - The state of the transaction. Must be one of
   *   [TransactionInfo.State][google.cloud.paymentgateway.issuerswitch.v1.TransactionInfo.State] values. Allowed comparison operators: `=`.
   *   * `errorCode` - Use this filter to list complaint transactions which
   *   have failed a particular error code. Allowed comparison
   *   operators: `=`.
   * You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in
   * parentheses. Expressions are combined with AND logic. No other logical
   * operators are supported.
   * Here are a few examples:
   *   * `state = SUCCEEDED` - The transaction's state is _SUCCEEDED_.
   *   * (createTime &lt; "2021-08-15T14:50:00Z")`
